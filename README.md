### Forecasting Catastrophe Risk: FEMA National Flood Insurance Program

##### Instructions for Running Code:

1. Download codebase and coordinates folder into directory

2. Download FEMA Redacted Claims V2 dataset from 
https://www.fema.gov/openfema-data-page/fima-nfip-redacted-claims-v2
and store result in FimaNFIPClaims.csv

3. Register an account with the Emergency Events Database and download the 
public EM-DAT table from 
https://doc.emdat.be/docs/data-structure-and-content/emdat-public-table/. Store 
the result in 
public_emdat_custom_request.xlsx

4. Run all code blocks in preprocessing.ipynb
  (NOTE: Code block which matches claims to storm magnitudes could run for a large number of hours. Took ~3 hrs on a laptop.)

6. Run all code blocks in modeling.ipynb
